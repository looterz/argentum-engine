# Bloomburrow AI Advisor Checklist

Instructions and checklist for improving the AI's play with Bloomburrow cards using the
`CardAdvisor` system.

## How It Works

The `CardAdvisor` system (`rules-engine/.../ai/advisor/`) lets you override the generic AI's
behavior for specific cards. Advisors hook into three decision points:

1. **`evaluateCast(CastContext)`** — Should the AI cast this spell/activate this ability right now?
   Returns a score override (or null to use default simulation). The context includes:
   - `state` / `projected` — full game state
   - `passScore` — score of doing nothing
   - `defaultScore` — what the generic 1-ply simulation scored
   - `evaluator` / `simulator` — for custom evaluation

2. **`respondToDecision(AdvisorDecisionContext)`** — How should the AI respond to a decision during
   this card's resolution? (targets, modes, yes/no, etc.) Returns a `DecisionResponse` or null.

3. **`attackPenalty(state, projected, entityId, playerId)`** — Score penalty for attacking with this
   creature. Positive values disincentivize attacking (10.0 = almost never attacks).

## Advisor Patterns

### Timing (evaluateCast)

| Pattern | When to use | Implementation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Hold for combat** | Combat tricks, pump spells | Penalize main phase (`passScore - 1.0`), allow combat (`return null`) |
| **Hold for opponent's turn** | Instant removal, counterspells, flash creatures | Penalize own main phase, allow opponent's turn |
| **Reactive play** | Protection spells (hexproof, indestructible) | When stack is non-empty, let simulation decide freely (`return null`) |
| **Cast when behind** | Board wipes | Check board value ratio, penalize when ahead |
| **Flash ambush** | Flash creatures | Boost during opponent's combat (`+3.0`), penalize own main phase |

### Decision Overrides (respondToDecision)

| Pattern | When to use | Implementation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Gift mode choice** | All gift cards | Use `pickBestGiftMode()` — simulates both modes with hand-size-scaled penalty |
| **Joint target simulation** | Bite/fight spells | Try all (my creature × their creature) combos, pick best board state |
| **Graveyard retrieval** | "Return up to N" spells | Always select max targets, rank by mana value |
| **Specific card logic** | Unique cards | Card-specific heuristics (e.g., Nocturnal Hunger life check) |

### Combat (attackPenalty)

| Pattern | When to use | Implementation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Don't attack** | Creatures with valuable tap abilities | Return high penalty (e.g., `10.0` for Goblin Sharpshooter) |

## How to Add an Advisor

1. Identify what the AI does wrong with the card (timing? targeting? mode choice?)
2. Pick the right pattern from above
3. Either add the card name to an existing advisor's `cardNames` set, or create a new
   `object MyAdvisor : CardAdvisor` in `BloomburrowAdvisorModule.kt`
4. Register it in `BloomburrowAdvisorModule.register()`
5. Run the benchmark to verify:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :rules-engine:test --tests "*.AdvisorBenchmark" -Dbenchmark=true -DbenchmarkGames=100 --rerun
   ```

## Key State Queries for Advisors

```kotlin
// Phase/timing
state.step.phase == Phase.COMBAT           // in combat?
state.step.isMainPhase                     // main phase?
state.activePlayerId == playerId           // our turn?
state.stack.isNotEmpty()                   // something on the stack?

// Board state
creatureBoardValue(state, projected, playerId)   // total creature value
creatureCount(projected, playerId)               // creature count
lifeTotal(state, playerId)                       // life total
handSize(state, playerId)                        // cards in hand

// Opponent
state.getOpponent(playerId)                      // opponent's entity ID
giftPenalty(state, playerId)                     // context-sensitive gift cost

// Creature details (from projected state)
projected.isCreature(entityId)
projected.getPower(entityId)
projected.getToughness(entityId)
projected.getKeywords(entityId)
projected.getController(entityId)
projected.getBattlefieldControlledBy(playerId)
```

## Priority Cards for Next Pass

High impact cards that likely need advisors but don't have one yet:

1. **Season cycle** (5 cards) — Budget modal spells with complex mode optimization. The generic
   `BudgetModalDecision` handler picks cheapest modes greedily, but optimal play requires evaluating
   which combination of modes produces the best board state.
2. **Class enchantments** (10 cards) — When to level up vs spend mana on creatures is a key
   strategic decision the generic AI can't evaluate.
3. **Pawpatch Formation** — Three-mode removal/utility spell.
4. **Stargaze** / **Portent of Calamity** — Complex card selection where generic AI may undervalue.
5. **Kitnap** — Gift aura with control effect.

## Running the Benchmark

```bash
# Quick validation (5 pairs = 10 games, ~5 seconds)
./gradlew :rules-engine:test --tests "*.AdvisorBenchmark" -Dbenchmark=true -DbenchmarkGames=5 --rerun

# Standard benchmark (100 pairs = 200 games, ~30-60 seconds)
./gradlew :rules-engine:test --tests "*.AdvisorBenchmark" -Dbenchmark=true -DbenchmarkGames=100 --rerun

# Large benchmark for statistical significance (500 pairs = 1000 games)
./gradlew :rules-engine:test --tests "*.AdvisorBenchmark" -Dbenchmark=true -DbenchmarkGames=500 --rerun
```

Each pair plays the same random Bloomburrow sealed deck twice (swapping who goes first) to reduce
first-player bias. Look for:
- **Advised win % > 50%** (excluding draws) = improvement
- **Balanced P1/P2 wins** = not just first-player bias
- **Run multiple times** — there's high variance between runs due to random decks
